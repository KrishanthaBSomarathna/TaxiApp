# Driver Availability & Date Validation Features

## Overview
This document describes the new features implemented to prevent double bookings and ensure proper date validation in the taxi booking app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Driver Availability Check
- **Prevents double bookings**: When a user books a driver for a specific date and time, other users cannot book the same driver for that time slot
- **Transactional locking**: Uses Firebase transactions to ensure atomic operations when creating bookings
- **Real-time availability**: Shows current driver availability status before allowing bookings

### 2. Date Validation
- **Future dates only**: Users can only select upcoming dates (tomorrow and beyond)
- **Past date prevention**: The date picker automatically prevents selection of today or past dates
- **Time validation**: Ensures selected time is in the future for the chosen date
- **Default time**: Sets default time to 9:00 AM for better user experience

### 3. User Booking Limits
- **One driver per day**: Users cannot book the same driver multiple times on the same day
- **Conflict prevention**: Checks existing user bookings before allowing new ones
- **Clear error messages**: Informs users when they try to create conflicting bookings

### 4. Availability Information
- **Driver status overview**: Shows which drivers are available for specific dates
- **Time slot details**: Displays available and booked time slots for selected dates
- **Real-time updates**: Reflects current booking status from Firebase database

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
```
/driver_locks/{driverName}/{dateTime} = bookingId
/bookings/{bookingId} = Booking object
```

### Key Functions

#### BookingActivity.kt
- `checkDriverAvailability()`: Checks if driver is free at specific time
- `showDriverAvailabilityForDate()`: Shows available time slots for a date
- `checkExistingUserBooking()`: Prevents user from booking same driver multiple times per day
- `isValidFutureDateTime()`: Validates selected date/time is in the future

#### MainActivity.kt
- `showDriverAvailabilityDialog()`: Shows overall driver availability status
- `showDriverBookingsDetail()`: Shows detailed booking information for specific drivers

### UI Components Added
- **Check availability button**: In booking screen to see driver availability
- **Availability status button**: In main screen to check all drivers' status
- **Enhanced date picker**: With future date validation and better UX

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Booking
1. User selects a future date (tomorrow or later)
2. User can check driver availability for the selected date
3. System validates that the selected date/time is in the future
4. User can see available time slots

### During Booking
1. System checks if driver is available at selected time
2. System verifies user hasn't already booked this driver for the same day
3. Transactional lock prevents race conditions
4. Clear error messages for any conflicts

### After Booking
1. Driver is marked as unavailable for that specific time slot
2. Other users cannot book the same driver at that time
3. User receives confirmation and notification

## Error Handling

### Common Scenarios
- **Driver already booked**: "Driver [Name] is not available at this time"
- **Past date selected**: "Please select a future date and time"
- **User already has booking**: "You already have a booking with [Driver] on this day"
- **Invalid time**: "Please select a future time"

### Fallback Mechanisms
- If availability check fails, falls back to transaction-based locking
- If database errors occur, provides clear error messages
- Graceful degradation when network issues arise

## Security Features

### Data Validation
- Sanitizes driver names for Firebase keys
- Validates all input coordinates and dates
- Prevents SQL injection and malicious data

### Access Control
- Users can only see their own bookings
- Driver availability is publicly readable but only authenticated users can book
- Transactional locks prevent unauthorized modifications

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases
1. **Date validation**: Try selecting past dates, today, and future dates
2. **Double booking**: Attempt to book the same driver at the same time from different accounts
3. **User limits**: Try booking the same driver multiple times on the same day
4. **Availability display**: Check that availability information is accurate and up-to-date
5. **Error handling**: Test various error scenarios and verify appropriate messages

### Edge Cases
- **Timezone differences**: Ensure date validation works across different timezones
- **Network failures**: Test behavior when Firebase is unavailable
- **Concurrent bookings**: Multiple users trying to book simultaneously
- **Invalid data**: Test with malformed dates, coordinates, or driver names

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Calendar view**: Show driver availability in a calendar format
2. **Recurring bookings**: Allow users to book regular rides
3. **Driver preferences**: Let drivers set their preferred working hours
4. **Booking modifications**: Allow users to modify existing bookings
5. **Push notifications**: Real-time updates when driver availability changes

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Caching**: Cache driver availability data locally
2. **Batch queries**: Optimize Firebase queries for multiple drivers
3. **Offline support**: Handle booking creation when offline
4. **Real-time sync**: Use Firebase real-time listeners for live updates

## Conclusion

These features significantly improve the taxi booking experience by:
- Preventing booking conflicts and double-bookings
- Ensuring users can only select valid future dates
- Providing clear visibility into driver availability
- Maintaining data integrity through transactional operations
- Offering a more professional and reliable booking system

The implementation follows Android best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing Firebase backend, providing a robust foundation for future enhancements.
